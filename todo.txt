TODO: 29/12/2025 implementations and questions:
    explore implication of link from markov chains to martingales again, does it only then mean we can speak of the theory below?
        if we know A on a "rich" class of f then we get a function in A and f that is a Martingale, what is this knowing on a rich class
    what stability is found when we have Af <= -cf + b as opposed to stability of distribution spoken of below?
    implement QM methods for solving Fokker-Planck by using analog to schrödinger's equation
    create a trigger that sees when FP eq only shows overdamped dynamics, i.e., only 2nd order partials w.r.t. spatial variables
        we should then be able to write down a master equation and easily solve it numerically
    find out if continuous time wrapper for the semigroups and resolvent is even sensible or if it is like MC for discretized PDE case
    clean forward and backword kolmogorov framework with fokker-planck in forward case if we have a density
    forward eq can either be with a law /mu_t or a density p, what do we do with this? is law programming sensible
    how to implement PDE's then SDE's then also diffusion equations
    make the demo into a demo for financial mathematics case
    add solvers for PDE's: Euler-Marumaya, Milstein, Runge-Kufta, Rosenbrock, more (see Kuznetsov 2023 and Rybakov 2023)
        solvers for PDE being Stochastic involving Lebesgue integral, Itô integral, (Lévy integral)
    make generator A be possibly a closed form generator (now it is only made from sampling i think)
    how to ensure we keep the bond between the Markov chains and the stochestic processes? through generator / martingale stuff?
    do we want to do something with weak vs strong sol. of a SDE (Yamada-Watanabe theorem)
    make the distinction that the MC simulation of average paths to calc semigroup is canonical ensembling
    make the distinction that the other way to calc the semigroup or resolvent is thus through closed form generator and SDE solving
    think of when what calculation is best, canonical ensembling, PDE analytical or even MC in discretized PDE
    create the framework that will find the local volatility (problem of inversion of the Fokker-Planck eqation)
        non parametrically: Dupire
        parametrically: Brigo & Mercurio (2003)
        for more info see Fengler (2008), Gatheral (2008), Musiela & Rutkowski (2008)
    think of when A can not be written closed form, which black-box transitions, learned kernels, complicated algorithmic dynamics are common
        maybe add these as demo's
    When we do have a closed form generator we might want to have some example closed forms
        corresponding to e.g. Black-Scholes, OU, Heston, CIR, etc
            in general these are Af(x) = b(x) * \diff f(x) + 1/2 \trace (a(x) \diff^2 f(x)), where a(x) = \sigma \sigma' (for smooth f)
        we also have closed forms if comming from continuous time Markov chain where we know the jump rates. This might be the main link!!!
        we have closed forms if we have Lévy / jump diffusions (maybe make examples of these aswell)
    Create a way to calculate the adjoint either numerically or analytically
        analytically we can use integration by parts
        numerically we can use CTMC
        analytically there should be more techniques in lecture on quantum mechanics (also on existence of adjoint and self adjointness etc.)
    providing closed form of adjoint should also be possible just like with the generator
    we will use the adjoint generator for the following things
        evolving either a law or density forward in time with the forward kolmogorov / Fokker-Planck equations
        computing transition densities / likelihoods for calibration / inference of something (for what?)
        finding stationary / invariant distributions by solving A^{*}p_{\infty} = 0 with normalization
        do a forward pricing trick: compute p(t,.|x) and price many payoffs at once by integrating u(t,x) = \int f(y)p(t,y|x)dy
            use it in risk setting by looking at the result of the forward equations for use in finding tail risk, (hitting probability)
    consider discounting in both the semigroup (to get Feynman-Kac) and in the resolvent (where it will just shift alpha)
        make the discounting possibly state-dependent
    Fokker-Planck equation path integral implementation
    I want to create a file that can show all kinds of (R^1 to R^3) demo's as graphs of things
